# VBA-challenge

This challenge was very challenging. Ultimately, it was a lot of variable tracking, for loops, and calculation using VBA. I looked up documentation for how to make this efficient like getting the last row, debugging how to make it apply to all sheets, and tested it on the testing workbook and the full workbook.
